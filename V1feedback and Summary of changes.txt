General
Maybe include more 'technical' 'technology' photos?

I personally like tabs across the top of the page

Have you researched other contractor's websites online? Might be worth doing some research. Ones who are sucesssfully working in London or similar cities today

I think you need a clear message of what your brand/product. I don't feel it's clear what you're trying to sell/say to your audience. What is it that you want people to get from your website?
What is the take away message that you want people viewing your website to have?


Maybe different pages? Seems like clicking on things e.g 'Richard Eldridge' at the top of the page just takes me to lower down on the page

Linked in link didn't seem to work. I clicked on it and then it didn't do anything then it didn't seem to be there anymore

I think you need more text, more information

contact me works but maybe have it integrated into the page? So that they can still see the page rather than it being a pop up. 
Maybe an online form that's always open. Just a personal preference though



'A bit more about me'
Maybe put qualifications before personal info
